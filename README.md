# Machine Learning Cypher

## Algorithms
First cypher partaker is the group of machine learning fundamentals and their python utilization. There is a link for all data sources.

## Spark
Within databricks cluster, I build several pyspark models for static data processing and aggregation as well as streaming data manipulation. The resources were provided in collaboration with [**Informationsfabrik GmbH**](https://www.informationsfabrik.com/) under the auspices of WWU lectures of Data Integration.

## Fraud Detection
Last Ml model in spotlight is **credit card fraud detector**. I've developed the model with measuring the performance of several different algorithms i.e. tensor shallow networks, random forrest classifier, gradient boosting classifier and SVC. The computation is done twice after balancing the dataset and reducing its volume.
